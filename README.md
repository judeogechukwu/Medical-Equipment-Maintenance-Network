# Decentralized Medical Equipment Maintenance Network

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform revolutionizes medical equipment maintenance by creating a transparent, efficient ecosystem connecting healthcare facilities, service technicians, and parts suppliers. By leveraging smart contracts and distributed ledger technology, the system ensures critical medical devices receive timely, qualified maintenance while providing immutable service records and streamlining resource allocation.

## Core Components

### Device Registration Contract
Records comprehensive details of hospital equipment including:
- Unique device identifiers and serial numbers
- Manufacturer specifications and compliance certifications
- Installation date and location within facility
- Maintenance history and service requirements
- Operating parameters and performance benchmarks
- Warranty information and service level agreements
- Critical failure history and resolution documentation

### Technician Verification Contract
Validates qualifications for specific devices through:
- Certification verification for different equipment types
- Manufacturer-specific training credentials
- Experience tracking with specific models and procedures
- Performance ratings from previous service events
- Continuing education and skill updates
- Specialized certifications (e.g., radiation safety, sterilization)
- Geographical service area and availability windows

### Service Scheduling Contract
Manages regular maintenance appointments via:
- Automated scheduling based on manufacturer requirements
- Predictive maintenance triggers from IoT device monitoring
- Priority-based queue management for critical equipment
- Conflict resolution for technician scheduling
- Notification system for all stakeholders
- Emergency service request handling
- Compliance tracking with regulatory maintenance requirements

### Parts Inventory Contract
Tracks availability of replacement components through:
- Real-time inventory visibility across multiple suppliers
- Authenticity verification of replacement parts
- Automated reordering based on usage patterns
- Just-in-time delivery coordination with service appointments
- Compatibility checking with specific device models
- Expiration date monitoring for time-sensitive components
- Chain-of-custody tracking for regulated components

## Key Benefits
